This is the next iteration of the multiplayer game. arrow keys move your player around and the / key will leave a marker where you are/were.

next step: get the app to work with the arrays of markers to prevent players from crossing - also increase score for getting four in a row - also have unique colors for each player and their markers.

HOW TO TRY THIS OUT
You'll have Node installed of course.
Pull the repo, and in a terminal cd to its directory.
type npm install to install all the needed modules.
type node app.js
open two browser tabs and go to localhost:8080 in each.
